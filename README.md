`GUITestRunner.jl` is a Julia standalone GUI for `TestRunner.jl` package based on `Tk.jl`. It is designed to display tests defined in `FactCheck.jl`, run them and show their results.

### Additional functions

+ You can **view details** of the specified test just by clicking on it. You can read them at the bottom of the main window or in a separate window (in order to do it click on the *Open details in new window* button).

+ You can also **open file with the tests on specific line** by clicking on the button next to the test name.

### Configuration

GUITestRunner can open your file with tests in a predifined text editor on the line where the test is written. To configure it edit script src/lineNumberButtonOnClick.sh or src/lineNumberButtonOnClick.bat (depending on your OS). This script is executed when a button with line number is clicked on, with following parameters:

1. line number,
2. file name.

An example script for opening the file in Kate (Linux):
	
```shell
kate -l $1 $2
```
	
An example script for opening the file in Atom (Windows):

```bat
atom %2:%1
```
